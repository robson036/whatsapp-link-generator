# **WhatsApp Link Generator**

## Motivation

As I like to browse used objects sale sites, I realized that it is very annoying to copy the seller's phone, save it on the cell phone and open it on whatsapp, or even, use a site that generates links.
That's why I created this simple extension that does nothing but allow a selected text to be converted into a link for whatsapp.
